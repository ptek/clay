Clay generates static pages using layouts and text snippets. It is something like a CMS for those who know html and would like to use their own text editor. Clay was inspired by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which is a simple tool to create a blog. The difference between clay and jekyll is that clay aims at a clear folder structure and simple templating using [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/). 

There are plans for adding a blogging support in clay too.
